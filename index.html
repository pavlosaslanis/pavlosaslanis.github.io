					  	<p>Monitoring crop growth is crucial for applying agronomic practices efficiently. 
						This study focus on spring barley parcels with available in-situ crop growth stage measurements 
						(recorded in Zadoks scale) in south-central Sweden over the period of 2017 – 2019. The aim was to 
						detect three specific crop growth stages of spring barley that are crucial for applying external inputs 
						(e.g. fungicides applications): (i) first node detectable (31DC), (ii) flag leaf ligule just visible (39DC),
						and (iii) first spikelet of inflorescence just visible (51DC). We describe a simple empirical approach based on
						Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) Sentinel-2 time-series. 
						TIMESAT 4.0 was deployed to reconstruct the NDVI and EVI2 trajectories using the Double Logistic (DL) smoothing 
						function. The available in-situ crop growth stage measurements were used to optimize the dynamic thresholds 
						(% of the amplitude of the season) for detecting the different crop growth stages of interest in the time-series 
						of the vegetation indices. The optimal thresholds for the stages 31DC, 39DC and 51DC based on NDVI were 74%, 92%,
						and 99% respectively; for EVI2 the optimal global thresholds were 70% (31DC), 91% (39DC), and 99% (51DC). 
						The results suggest that EVI2 was more accurate than NDVI for detecting the crop growth stages of interest 
						in terms of R2 and RMSE. Overall,  the study showed the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 in crop phenology 
						studies and demonstrated its potential uses and inaccuracies regarding the detection of three specific crop
						growth stages of spring barley that are important in agronomic management.</p><br>

					  	<h2 class="heading"> <b>BSc Thesis </b> <br> Mapping Soil Erosion Susceptibility using RULSE and GIS - An Empirical Assesment of Xerias River Basin, Greece </h2>
					  	<p> In this thesis, an effort to predict mean annual soil loss has been conducted
						for the watershed of Xerias (Peloponnese). For the prediction, the Revised Universal
						Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model, a modification of the USLE model, has been
						adopted in a Geographical Information System framework. The RUSLE factors were
						calculated (in the form of raster layers) for the area of interest. The R-factor was
						calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor was estimated
						using soil maps available from the Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe (SGDBE) in
						conjunction with the LUCAS database. The LS-factor was calculated from a 30m
						digital elevation model (ASTER DEM). The C-factor was calculated using the Corine
						2000 database. The P-factor in absence of data was set to 1. The results showed that
						in more than 85% of the study area the mean annual soil loss amounts were less
						than 6.8 t ha−1yr−1 while the mean annual soil loss is predicted up to 3.52
						t ha−1yr−1
						. For the reliability assessment of the results, a comparison has been
						made between the results of this thesis with the results of the European Commission
						researches. This comparison showed that the classes of soil loss estimations in 85.6%
						of the study area fell within the range of soil loss classes obtained from European
						Commission researches. In general, it can be said that the reliability of the used data
						and used methods is too low and too many uncertainties exist for a reliable
						calculation of soil loss amounts in the watershed of Xerias using the RUSLE model.
						Nonetheless, the results of this thesis could be proven useful for the identification of
						the spatial patterns of soil erosion, which can make these methods highly useful, since
						such information is critical for erosion control and thus for the protection of the
						environment.</p><br>

					    <p>
  This project aimed to create a thematic map (land cover) for Lund municipality by using satellite data (Sentinel-2A) along with in situ measurements. Two classification methods are used in order to classify the land cover types in Lund municipality, named ANN and minimum distance. The highest classification accuracy was obtained by ANN which is 54% compared to minimum distance classifier. It was concluded that using ANN method is a better option than minimum distance with respect to accuracy. Furthermore, it is found that Minimum distance classifier is a simpler method and less time consuming but should not be preferred for applications where the accuracy of the classification is critical.

					    <p>The concept of accessibility plays an important role in many of our conscious choices: How far are you willing to walk to buy a lunch? How much time are you willing to spend to commute to a new working place? The accessibility has been modelled here in the form of travel time to hospitals and markets by using a raster-based cost distance analysis as opposed to a vector-based network analysis. Results with a reasonable accuracy were obtained from the service area analysis. There were certain areas that were modelled poorly due to big gaps in between roads in rural areas or areas with an incomplete road network. Also, areas in mountainous areas with steep slopes were modelled differently.</p><br>

					    <p> Here is a Python/ArcGIS-ArcToolbox to automate the multi-temporal calculation of a river’s sinuosity index.  The sinuosity index  is also known as just sinuosity and describes the tendency of the rivers to meander (i.e. to deviate from the straight flow), and it is defined as the total length of the river (L) divided by the straight distance (D) between the starting and ending point of the river. The utilization of arcpy package can be proven time efficient when it comes to the automation of tasks with a time demanding workflow. In such a case, the developed toolbox can be used to assess the temporal changes in the sinuosity values of a river in an automated manner, but the results should always interpreted with critical thinking.</p><br>
